### Editors
- There are currently 3 editors: Spirit, Power, and Blight
- They are found on right side of mod by click the "Show Editors" button
- Make sure you have selected a player color first

### Spirits
#### In place of following these instructions you can instead use https://spiritislandbuilder.com/ and hit the "Export TTS file" button
- https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/custom-content/custom-tile/
- Set name of object to that of spirit
  - https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/player-guides/context-menu/
- Place object onto spirit editor and click "Make Me A Spirit!" button
  - This will add the "Spirit" tag as well as basic scripting
  - The "Choose Spirit" button should now appear on the backside of the panel
    - Note: You may have inverted the top and bottom images
- Add tag to object for spirit's complexity, one of the following:
  - https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/game-tools/object-tags/#tagging
  - "Low"
  - "Moderate"
  - "High"
  - "Very High"
- Add tag to object for additional rules spirit uses, this will make sure the content can't be used without the required rules:
  - https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/game-tools/object-tags/#tagging
  - "Requires Tokens"
  - "Requires Badlands"
  - "Requires Isolate"
- Add snap points to presence track(s) where presence should be setup

  - Set the state to match the element
  - Stack elements on top of the threshold token (X)
  - Once all thresholds are set press the "Update Threshold" button (the top one)
  - Note: for thresholds with OR (e.g. Trickster), you'll need to manually edit the json file to add a second threshold at the exact same coordinates as the other one

  - Once all thresholds are set press the "Update Threshold" button (the bottom one)
  - Note: for thresholds with OR (e.g. Trickster), you'll need to manually edit the json file to add a second threshold at the exact same coordinates as the other one
  - Note: the decal will appear smaller than the actual size of the object, just a TTS limitation for how small an object can be
