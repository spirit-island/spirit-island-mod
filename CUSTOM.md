### Editors
- There are currently 3 editors: Spirit, Power, and Blight
- They are found on right side of mod by click the "Show Editors" button
- Make sure you have selected a player color first

### Spirits
#### In place of following these instructions you can instead use https://spiritislandbuilder.com/ and hit the "Export TTS file" button
- https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/custom-content/custom-tile/
- Set name of object to that of spirit
  - https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/player-guides/context-menu/
- Place object onto spirit editor and click "Make Me A Spirit!" button
  - This will add the "Spirit" tag as well as basic scripting
  - The "Choose Spirit" button should now appear on the backside of the panel
    - Note: You may have inverted the top and bottom images
- Add tag to object for spirit's complexity, one of the following:
  - https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/game-tools/object-tags/#tagging
  - "Low"
  - "Moderate"
  - "High"
  - "Very High"
- Add snap points to presence track(s) where presence should be setup
  - https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/game-tools/snap-point-tool/
  - Note: Make sure spirit panel is locked first
  - Note: F10 is the keyboard shortcut to switch to Snap Point Tool
- Presence track fixed (non choice) elements:
  - Set the state to match the element
  - If multiple elements appear on same spot simply stack elements on top of each other
  - Once all elements are set press the "Update Elements" button
- Presence track energy:
  - For each time that energy gain increases grab energy tokens from bag and stack them onto spot
  - Energy tokens have a 2nd state to be used for bonus energy (e.g. Finder)
  - Once all energy is set press the "Update Energy" button
  - Note: You don't need to put them on every spot, only when income increases
  - Note: Don't forget about starting spot if it's not zero
- Innate thresholds:
  - Grab a threshold token (X) and place it onto object where you want the threshold decal to appear
  - Then grab elements from the element bag right next to threshold
  - Set the state to match the element
  - Stack elements on top of the threshold token (X)
  - Once all thresholds are set press the "Update Threshold" button (the top one)
  - Note: for thresholds with OR (e.g. Trickster), you'll need to manually edit the json file to add a second threshold at the exact same coordinates as the other one

### Power Cards

  - The card/deck image should be in portrait orientation
- Set name of object to that of power card

  - Then grab elements from the element bag right next to threshold
  - Set the state to match the element
  - Stack elements on top of the threshold token (X)
  - Once all thresholds are set press the "Update Threshold" button (the bottom one)
  - Note: for thresholds with OR (e.g. Trickster), you'll need to manually edit the json file to add a second threshold at the exact same coordinates as the other one
  - Note: the decal will appear smaller than the actual size of the object, just a TTS limitation for how small an object can be

### Aspects
- https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/custom-content/custom-deck/
  - The card/deck image should be in landscape orientation
- Set name of object to that of aspect
  - https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/player-guides/context-menu/
