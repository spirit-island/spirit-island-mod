### Intro
- For the most part, the only things automated by the mod are Time Passes and Setup (not including the Initial Explore and Spirit Setup)
- It is not recommended to use the Rewind / Fast Forward Buttons (they often break scripted mods)
- Aspects of this mod may not match with the printed version as it aims to stay updated with errata (printed or not)
  - E.g. The Blight Card has 1 more Blight on it during Setup (https://querki.net/u/darker/spirit-island-faq/#!one-more-blight-errata)
- To use beta versions of the mod:
  - Download the TTS save from the pinned messages in #tabletop-simulator-mod channel (https://discord.gg/G84zRCrJZa)
  - Place that save file at: My Documents/My Games/Tabletop Simulator/Saves
  - Load the save:
    - Open a lobby in TTS
    - "Games" (top of the screen) &gt; "Save & Load" &gt; click the save file &gt; "Load"

### Troubleshooting
- Some objects are not loading (appearing white or yellow and black)
  - Go to Menu &gt; Configuration &gt; General and uncheck "Mod Caching" &gt; reload the Mod
  - Optionally you can turn Mod Caching back on (this will decrease load times in the future)
- The mod gets stuck at a certain % when loading
  - You've run out of memory. While TTS minimum is 4GB, the Spirit Island mod requires more than this, 8GB advised. If you've got less than 4GB ram, or are playing on a 32-bit operating system, you cannot play this mod.
- An Island Board is rotated/sized incorrectly for some players
  - The player(s) with the issues should reconnect, or
  - A player without the issues should use the Gizmo Tool (F8) and change the position/rotation/scale of the effected Island Board(s) by +0.01
